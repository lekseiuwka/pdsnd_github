# Explore US Bikeshare data :bike::eyes:
##### Date created: 2021/08/22



### Description
This is interactive program which takes user raw input and shares interesting data insights about bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
Here are the questions that you can answer using this program:
- Popular times of travel
- Popular stations and trip
- Trip duration
- Audience details (client type, gender, etc)

You can filter data by City, Month and Day of the week.

In this project I used data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States

### Sowtware used
- Python 3, NumPy, and pandas libraries
- A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows)

### Files used
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv
